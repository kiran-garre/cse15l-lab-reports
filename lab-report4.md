## Step 4:
![Image](/lab-report4-images/running-ssh.png)
Keys pressed: `<up> + <enter>`  
The command `ssh kgarre@ieng6.ucsd.edu` was one up in my command history, so I pressed the up arrow to quickly access it. I then pressed `<enter>` to run the command.


## Step 5:
![Image](/lab-report4-images/git-cloning-and-cd.png)
Keys pressed: `<ctrl-r> + git + <enter> + cd lab7 + <enter>`  
Pressing `Ctrl-R` allows me to search through my command history. Simply typing `git` autocompletes to `git clone git@github.com:kiran-garre/lab7.git` since that was the only `git` command I used. 
I then pressed `<enter>` to run the command. I then used the command `cd lab7` to change to the `/lab7` directory. (I could `cd` by searching through my command history, but I found it to be faster to 
just type the command myself.)


## Step 6:
![Image](/lab-report4-images/running-bash-test.png)
Keys pressed: `<ctrl-r> + bas + <enter>`  
Pressing `Ctrl-R` allows me to search through my command history. Simply typing `"bas"` autocompletes to `bash test.sh` since that was the only `bash` command I used. 
I then pressed `<enter>` to run the tests in `test.sh`.


## Step 7:
![Image](/lab-report4-images/vimming.png)
Keys pressed: `<ctrl-r> + vim + <enter> + gg + 43j + e + r2 + :x + <enter>`    
Pressing `Ctrl-R` allows me to search through my command history. Simply typing `vim` autocompletes to `vim ListExamples.java` since that was the only `vim` command I used.   
I then pressed `<enter>` to begin editing `ListExamples.java` with `vim`.  
Pressing `gg` takes me to the top of the file. I do this because sometimes the cursor starts in an unexpected place, so I just go to the top of file. Pressing `43j` performs the 
motion `j` (which moves the cursor a line down). The line to be changed is on line 44, so if the cursor starts on line 1, jumping down 43 times gets to the correct line.  
Pressing `e` moves to the end of the first word of the line, putting me at the "1" of "index1".  
Pressing `r2` replaces the current character with the character "2", so the word became "index2".  
Pressing `:x` saves and exits the file.


## Step 8:
![Image](/lab-report4-images/bash-testing-again.png)  
Keys pressed: `<up> + <up> + <enter>`  
The command `bash test.sh` is two commands up in my command history (from step 6), so pressing the up arrow twice lets me quickly access the command. Pressing `<enter>` runs the command. 


## Step 9:
![Image](/lab-report4-images/gitting.png)
Keys pressed: `<ctrl-r> + git a + <enter> + <ctrl-r> + git co + <enter> + <ctrl-r> + git push + <enter>`  
Pressing `Ctrl-R` allows me to search through my command history. Simply typing `git a` autocompletes to `git add .` since that is the only command I used that starts with `"git a"`.
I then press `Ctrl-R` again to search through my command history. Typing `git co` autocompletes to `git commit -m "n"` (since I used this command in an earlier run). Simply typing `git c` would not be enough because it would autocomplete to the `git clone` from before.
I then type `git push` to push the changes to Github. (I found that typing out the command was faster than searching through my history).
